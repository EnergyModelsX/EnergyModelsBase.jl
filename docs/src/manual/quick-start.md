# Quick Start

>  1. Install the most recent version of [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
>  2. Install the package [`EnergyModelsBase`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsBase.jl/) and the time package [`TimeStruct`](https://sintefore.github.io/TimeStruct.jl/), by running:
>     ```
>     ] add TimeStruct
>     ] add EnergyModelsBase
>     ```

!!! note
    If you receive the error that one of the packages is not yet registered, you have to add the packages using the GitHub repositories through
    ```
    ] add https://github.com/sintefore/TimeStruct.jl
    ] add https://github.com/EnergyModelsX/EnergyModelsBase.jl
    ```
    Once the packages are registered, this is not required.
