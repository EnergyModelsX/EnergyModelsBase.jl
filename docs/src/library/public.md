## Resources

`Resource`s correspond to the mass/energy that is converted or transported within an energy system.
`Resource`s are discrete, that is they do not have as default additional variables, *e.g.* pressure or temperature, associated with them.
Instead, they are implemented through flows and levels, as explained in *[Optimization variables](@ref optimization_variables)*.

### `Resource` types

The following resources are implemented in `EnergyModelsBase.jl`.
`EnergyModelsBase.jl` differentiates between `ResourceCarrier` and `ResourceEmit` resources.
The key difference between both is that `ResourceEmit` resources can have emissions, *e.g.*, CO‚ÇÇ or methane.
Emissions are accounted for and can have either a cap and/or a price associated with them.

One important field for a resource is the CO‚ÇÇ intensity (`co2_int`).
CO‚ÇÇ is handled differently than other emissions as the emissions are fundamental properties of a fuel based on the carbon content.

```@docs
Resource
ResourceCarrier
ResourceEmit
```

### Functions for accessing fields of `Resource` types

The following functions are declared for accessing fields from a `Resource` type.
If you want to introduce new `Resource` types, it is important that this function are either functional for your new types or you have to declare a corresponding function.

```@docs
co2_int
```

## Nodes

`Node`s are used in `EnergyModelsBase.jl` to convert `Resource`s.
They are coupled to the rest of the system through the *[Flow variables](@ref var_flow)*.
Nodes are the key types for extending `EnergyModelsBase.jl` through dispatch.
You can find an introduction of the different node types on the page *[Creating a new node](@ref create_new_node)*

### Abstract `Node` types

The following abstract node types are implemented in the `EnergyModelsBase.jl`.
These abstract types are relevant for dispatching in individual functions.

```@docs
Source
NetworkNode
Sink
Storage
Availability
```

### [Reference node types](@id sec_lib_public_refnodes)

The following composite types are inmplemented in the `EnergyModelsBase.jl`.
They can be used for describing a simple energy system without any non-linear or binary based expressions.
Hence, there are, *e.g.*, no operation point specific efficiencies implemented.

```@docs
RefSource
RefNetworkNode
RefSink
RefStorage
GenAvailability
```

### [Functions for accessing fields of `Node` types](@id functions_fields_node)

The following functions are declared for accessing fields from a `Node` type.

!!! warning
    If you want to introduce new `Node` types, it is important that these functions are either functional for your new types or you have to declare corresponding functions.
    The first approach can be achieved through using the same name for the respective fields.

    The functions `storage_resource` is only required for `Storage` nodes, when you plan to use the implemented constraint function `constraints_flow_in`.
    The functions `surplus_penalty` and `deficit_penalty` are only required for `Sink` nodes if you plan to use the implemented constraint function `constraints_opex_var`.

```@docs
capacity
opex_var
opex_fixed
inputs
outputs
node_data
storage_resource
surplus_penalty
deficit_penalty
```

### Functions for identifying `Node`s

The following functions are declared for filtering on `Node` types.

!!! warning
    If you want to introduce new `Node` types, it is important that the functions `has_input`, `has_output`, and `has_emissions` are either functional for your new types or you have to declare corresponding functions.
    The first approach can be achieved through using the same name for the respective fields.

    The functions `nodes_input`, `nodes_output`, and `nodes_emissions` are not used in the model as they are replaced by the build in filter function as, *e.g.*, `filter(has_input, ùí©)`.
    In practice, they provide a pre-defined approach for filtering nodes and do not require additional modifications.
    They can be used in potential extensions.

```@docs
nodes_input
nodes_output
nodes_emissions
has_input
has_output
has_emissions
```

### Legacy constructors

The following legacy constructors are implemented to avoid changing each individual model after updates in the core structure.
It is however uncertain, how long they will remain in the model.
To this end, it is suggest to adjust them with the reference nodes described above.

```@docs
RefNetwork
RefNetworkEmissions
RefStorageEmissions
```

## Links

`Link`s are connecting the individual `Node`s for the exchange of energy/mass.
`Link`s are directional, that is transport of mass/energy is only allowed in a single direction.

### `Link` types

The following types for links are implemented in `EnergyModelsBase.jl`.
The thought process is to dispatch on the [`EMB.Formulation`](@ref) of a link as additional option.
This is in the current stage not implemented.

```@docs
Link
Direct
Linear
```

### Functions for accessing fields of `Link` types

The following functions are declared for accessing fields from a `Link` type.

!!! warning
    If you want to introduce new `Link` types, it is important that the function `formulation` is either functional for your new types or you have to declare a corresponding function.
    The first approach can be achieved through using the same name for the respective fields.

```@docs
formulation
```

## Model and data

### `EnergyModel` and `Data` types

The type `EnergyModel` is used for creating the global parameters of a model.
It can be as well used for extending `EnergyModelsBase.jl` as described in the section *[Extensions to the model](@ref sec_phil_ext)*.
`EnergyModelsBase.jl` only provides an `OperationalModel` while `InvestmentModel` is added through the extension `EnergyModelsInvestments.jl`

```@docs
EnergyModel
OperationalModel
```

In addition, the following `Data` types are introduced for introducing additional parameters, variables, and constraints to the `Node`s.
The approach of using the `data` field of `Node`s is explained on the page *[Data functions](@ref data_functions)*.
`EmptyData` is no longer relevant for the modelling, but it is retained for avoiding any problems with existing models.

```@docs
Data
EmptyData
```

### Functions for accessing fields of `EnergyModel` types

The following functions are declared for accessing fields from a `EnergyModel` type.

!!! warning
    If you want to introduce new `EnergyModel` types, it is important that the functions `emission_limit`, `emission_price`, and `co2_instance` are either functional for your new types or you have to declare corresponding functions.
    The first approach can be achieved through using the same name for the respective fields.

```@docs
emission_limit
emission_price
co2_instance
```

## Functions for running the model

The following functions are provided for both creating a model using `EnergyModelsBase.jl` and solving said model.
Both functions have the input `case` and `model`.
`run_model` calls `create_model` in the function, hence, it is not necessary to call the function beforehand.

The `case` dictionary has to follow a certain outline.
In this case, it is simplest to look at the provided *[examples](https://gitlab.sintef.no/clean_export/energymodelsbase.jl/-/tree/main/examples)*.

!!! note
    We are currently debating to replace the dictionary used for `case` as well with a composite type.
This will lead to breacking changes, but should be simple to adjust for.

```@docs
create_model
run_model
```

## Functions for extending the model

The following functions are used for developing new nodes.
See the page *[Creating a new node](@ref create_new_node)* for a detailed explanation on how to create a new node.

```@docs
variables_node
create_node
```

## Constraint functions

The following functions can be used in new developed nodes to include constraints.
See the pages *[Constraint functions](@ref constraint_functions)* and *[Data functions](@ref data_functions)* for a detailed explanation on their usage.

!!! warning
    The function `constraints_capacity_installed` should not be changed.
    It is used for the inclusion of investments through `EnergyModelsInvestments.jl`.
    It also has to be called, if you create a new function `constraints_capacity`.

```@docs
constraints_flow_in
constraints_flow_out
constraints_capacity
constraints_capacity_installed
constraints_level
constraints_opex_var
constraints_opex_fixed
constraints_data
```

## [Emission data](@id sec_lib_public_emdata)

Emission data are used to provide the individual nodes with potential emissions.
The approach is also explained on the page *[Data functions](@ref data_functions)*.

### `Emission` types

The thought process with `EmissionData` is to provide the user with options for each individual node to include emissions and potentially capture or not.
The individual types can be used for all included *[reference `Node`s](@ref sec_lib_public_refnodes)*, although capture is not possible for `Sink` nodes due to the lack of an output.

```@docs
EmissionsData
CaptureData
EmissionsEnergy
EmissionsProcess
CaptureEnergyEmissions
CaptureProcessEmissions
CaptureProcessEnergyEmissions
```

### Functions for accessing fields of `EmissionsData` types

The following functions are declared for accessing fields from a `EmissionsData` type.

!!! warning
    If you want to introduce new `EmissionsData` types, it is important that the functions `co2_capture` and `process_emissions` are either functional for your new types or you have to declare corresponding functions.
    The first approach can be achieved through using the same name for the respective fields.

```@docs
co2_capture
process_emissions
```
