Abstract type for `EmissionsData` can be used to dispatch on different types of
capture configurations.

  through the variable `:cap_use`. It allows for an input as `TimeProfile` or `Float64`.
- **`co2_capture::Float64`** is the CO₂ capture rate.

- **[`CaptureProcessEnergyEmissions`](@ref)**: Capture both the process emissions and the
  energy usage related emissions.
- **[`CaptureProcessEmissions`](@ref)**: Capture the process emissions, but not the
  energy usage related emissions.

  the process emissions. Does not require `emissions` as input.

    SingleInvData <: InvestmentData

Extra investment data for type investments. The extra investment data has only a single
field in which `AbstractInvData` has to be added.

The advantage of separating `AbstractInvData` from the `InvestmentData` node is to allow
easier separation of `EnergyModelsInvestments` and `EnergyModelsBase` and provides the user
with the potential of introducing new capacities for types.

# Fields
- **`cap::AbstractInvData`** is the investment data for the capacity.

When multiple inputs are provided, a constructor directly creates the corresponding
`AbstractInvData`.

# Fields
- **`capex::TimeProfile`** is the capital costs for investing in a capacity. The value is
  relative to the added capacity.
- **`max_inst::TimeProfile`** is the maximum installed capacity in a strategic period.
- **`initial::Real`** is the initial capacity. This results in the creation of a
  [`StartInvData`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments.StartInvData) type for the investment data.
- **`inv_mode::Investment`** is the chosen investment mode for the technology. The following
  investment modes are currently available:
  [`BinaryInvestment`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments),
  [`DiscreteInvestment`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments),
  [`ContinuousInvestment`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments),
  [`SemiContinuousInvestment`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments), or
  [`FixedInvestment`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments).
- **`life_mode::LifetimeMode`** is type of handling the lifetime. Several different
  alternatives can be used:
  [`UnlimitedLife`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments),
  [`StudyLife`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments),
  [`PeriodLife`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments), or
  [`RollingLife`](@extref EnergyModelsInvestments). If `life_mode` is not specified, the

Legacy constructor for a `InvData`.

The new storage descriptions allows now for a reduction in functions which is used
to make `EnergModelsInvestments` less dependent on `EnergyModelsBase`.

The core changes to the existing structure is the move of the required parameters to the
type `Investment` (*e.g.*, the minimum and maximum added capacity is only required
for investment modes that require these parameters) as well as moving the `lifetime` to the
type `LifetimeMode`, when required.
