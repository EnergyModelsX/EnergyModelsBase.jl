`EnergyModelsBase` is the core package for building flexible multi-energy-carrier energy systems models.
It is designed to model the basic operations of various generation, conversion and storage technologies.
`EnergyModelsBase` is designed to enable optimization of operations, and to be be easily extendible to investment models, and/or to include new technologies or more detailed models of key technologies.

## Error in stable documentation

The stable documentation (based on the registered version) has currently the following error.
In the description of the variables, we wrote in the [Section on capacity variables](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsBase.jl/stable/manual/optimization-variables/#man-opt_var-cap):

```julia
for t_inv ‚àà ùíØ·¥µ‚Åø·µõ, n ‚àà ùí©À¢·µò·µá
    insertvar!(stor_level_Œî_sp, n, t_inv)
end
```

The correct solution is

```julia
for t_inv ‚àà ùíØ·¥µ‚Åø·µõ, n ‚àà ùí©À¢·µò·µá
    insertvar!(m[:stor_level_Œî_sp], n, t_inv)
end
```

## Usage

The usage of the package is best illustrated through the commented [`examples`](examples).
The examples are minimum working examples highlighting how to build simple energy system models.
